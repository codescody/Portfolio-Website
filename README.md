## Code Snippet

Particularly proud of the testing and first time use of media queries to make images and formats readable.

## Issues and Resolutions

 Took time to figure out the right positioning for each element but with enough practice flex was starting to become easier. Media queries were difficult at first with images and font sizing but was able to find proper values that made it easier. Javascript was challenging to figure out but managed to get my first animation working.
